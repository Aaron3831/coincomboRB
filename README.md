## Description

_Coin Combinations
Have you seen those coin slides used by cash registers that automatically return the correct amount of change? Build a Sinatra website that lets a user enter an amount of cents and shows the smallest number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies needed to make that change. Again, before you begin creating any webpages, make sure you build the method with good, clear specs first, code that passes the specs. and any necessary refactoring. You should NOT touch Sinatra until your methods have successfully implemented all of the behaviors you've identified in your specs.

In order to do this project, you will need to know about until loops. Here is an example of what using until looks like:

counter = 1
until counter.==(3)
  puts "Hello"
  counter = counter.+(1)
end
until loops are similar to times loops, except that instead of looping for a set amount of iterations, it will keep going until a condition is met. So in the example above, until the value of counter is equal to 3, the loop will keep going and print out "Hello" "Hello". Make sure you set a condition that will eventually be true or else you will find yourself in an infinite loop.

Bonus points: Imagine that there are only a certain number of quarters, dimes and nickels available (and an infinite number of pennies so change can always be made). Make your website notify the user when a certain coin is unavailable and still provide the correct alternative coin combination: "We are out of dimes, your change for 41 cents is 1 quarter, 3 nickels and 1 penny".
